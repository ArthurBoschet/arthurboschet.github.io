I am a student at McGill university, originally from Paris, France, completing my final year of Bioengineering with a minor in Computer Science. I have a special interest in the use of computer science and datascience to tackle modern problems in medecine and biology and hope to maximize my contributions in the field! 
Outside of my work, I enjoy surfing, lifting weights and trying new restaurants.
