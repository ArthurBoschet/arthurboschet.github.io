I am a professional Master's student in Machine Learning at Université de Montréal, currently doing a research internship at <a href="https://mila.quebec/en/professional-programs/">Optina Diagnostics</a> under the supervision of Prof. Ioannis Mitliagkas and Jean-Sébastien Grondin. I am working on the generation of synthetic medical images via diffusion and VQ-GANs to enhance a self-supervised learning pipeline used for the classification of Amyloid-β, whose aggregation is associated with Alzheimer's disease.

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Bioengineering with a minor in Computer Science from McGill University. I am deeply passionate about leveraging the power of Deep Learning to tackle modern problems in medicine and biology. I have worked on various medical use cases such as CT and MRI scan segmentation with UNet architectures, the use of Graph Neural Networks to predict protein-protein interactions, motor imagery EEG-based systems, sentiment analysis of Instagram posts related to Covid, and the creation of an intelligent surgical drain.
