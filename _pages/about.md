I am a professional Master’s student in Machine Learning at the Université de Montréal, holding a Bachelor's degree in Bioengineering with a minor in Computer Science from McGill University. I am deeply passionate about leveraging the power of Deep Learning to tackle modern problems in medicine and biology. My current research focuses on the use of Graph Neural Networks to predict protein interactions and aid biologists in discovering new cellular pathways. Additionally, I have experience in several other areas including the development of motor imagery EEG-based systems, sentiment analysis of Instagram posts related to Covid, and the creation of an intelligent surgical drain.
