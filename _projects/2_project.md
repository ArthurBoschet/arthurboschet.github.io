This project involved designing and implementing a data analysis pipeline to analyse COVID-19 related Instagram behaviors and sentiments. We were able to create a hashtag network that linked ideas frequently used together by users. This network was further analysed with graph clustering techniques, centrality measures and a BERT transformer neural network for user sentiment analysis. This transformer was fine-tuned for our purposes using google cloud GPUs. This project allowed me and my team to obtain second place at the STEM Fellowship's 2020 National Undergraduate Big Data Challenge. You can watch our presentation video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99EGW25IigQ">here</a> on github. The code is available on github <a href="https://github.com/brenda-shen/2020-Big-Data-Challenge">here</a> on github! This study was rewarded with a recent acceptance at the STEM Fellowship journal for publication.
