Protein-protein interaction (PPI) refers to the interaction between two or more protein molecules. In order to gain a deeper understanding of the biological processes that occur within cells, both under normal and diseased conditions, it is essential to study PPIs and the various types of interactions they form. These interactions include antigen recognition and signal transduction in the immune system, and play a crucial role in increasing our understanding of molecular mechanisms and protein functions. This information can then be used to identify potential target areas for therapy and drug development. However, the experimental methods required to discover new PPIs can be costly and time-consuming. To overcome this challenge, computational methods for PPI prediction can help biologists identify the most probable undiscovered interactions. This project evaluates the performance of multiple algorithms, such as Node2Vec and Graph Neural Networks, for PPI discovery on the string database. The code is available <a href="https://github.com/ArthurBoschet/PPIPrediction">here</a> on github.
